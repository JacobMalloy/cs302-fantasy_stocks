Challenge07 Report:
I think that the instructions for this challenge were very unclear. I had a lot of questions about what the rubric was for why a lot 
of this is individual work. I do think that the challenge helped us get started and get in a good place, but I wish it was more specific
in what it wanted in the instructions.
