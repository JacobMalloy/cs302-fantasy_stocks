Challenge07 Report:

This challenge went alright. I was not terribly sure what was expected, and it seemed that the ta's where not completely sure
either. I also felt like 6 hours was alot since I usually spend less than 2 on each project. But overall it has gone well and
I feel like I have a really good start in analyzing data and scoring the players.
